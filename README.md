## Election-Audit Summary
This script which was used to find the results in a congressional race can also be applied to a gubernatorial or presidential race with some exceptions. For example, in the gubernatorial race you would change the scope of the analysis to cover a statewide race, and for the presidential race you could change it to have a natinoal scope of all 50 states instead of just by counties. Such changes would be reflected in the script.
